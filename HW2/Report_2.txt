Through this assignment, my fundamental knowledge about bits and bytes and encryption increased as I familiarized myself with the working with binary and hexadecimal. Some problems I encounter were figuring out the redundancy of my previous code, in which I converted a binary integer into a string just to convert it back into an integer and then back to a string. I have fixed that portion of the first code too and the code just looks more fluid and cleaner than it did before. How I solved the problems this time is the same as how I did it last time. I set clear goals in the code, working on one piece at a time. I would start with one function and then as I was beginning to finish up that function, I created drafts of other functions so I would have a clear next goal to accomplish.
