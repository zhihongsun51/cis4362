This code was written in python 2.7.12. It is expected to work with the packages provided by python 2.7.12. Some bugs that have appeared is it cannot take a redirection in the command line, i.e. cat foo > ./prog1_1 will not work but cat foo | ./prog1_1 will work. It will also not run as just prog1_1 but must be called as ./prog1_1. It also cannot compile on sand.cise.ufl.edu because the python on sand does not have the package re. However, that seems to be solved by using python 2.7.12.
