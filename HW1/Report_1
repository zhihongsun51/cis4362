At first, manipulating the binary bytes was difficult but as I worked more with it, I got the hang of it better. How I approached these problems was tackle each small bit at a time. First I tried getting part of the cmd to work. Then I approached the binary to hexadecimal conversion process. All in all, I learned how to convert from binary to hexadecimal, how to manipulate bytes and the process of encryption and decryption.
